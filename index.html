    <p>Color Cop is a multi-purpose color picker for web designers and programmers. It identifies and represents colors in various hex color code formats.  Simply drag the eyedropper control to any location on the screen and release.  The hex color code for the selected color will be automatically copied to the clipboard. See other <a class="link" href="/features">features</a>.</p>
    <p>The interest, help, and donations from users have kept this project alive such as our <a href="http://www.webhostingsearch.com">web hosting</a> expenses.  If you enjoy the software, please consider sending a small <a class="link" href="/donate">donation</a>. Google's AdSense program has also helped by providing sponsored links for you to visit.</p>
    <p>Another way to help is to suggest new features.  Do you have an idea for a feature that should be added to Color Cop? An example is the screen measurement feature:  Press the Control key while using the eyedropper and you will be able to measure elements on the screen in pixels.</p>
