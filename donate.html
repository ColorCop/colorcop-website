<p>I don't charge for Color Cop.  It's yours for free and it will stay that way.  I've had a lot of fun creating it and learning new things along the way.  If you are happy with the app and would like to show your appreciation, please donate.</p>

<p>If you already have a <b>PayPal</b> account it's even easier to make your secure donation for Color Cop. Simply follow the link below (click on the PayPal button):</p>

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" />
    <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="K4EZ5E8GBQE76" />
    <input type="image" src="/images/btn_donate_LG.gif" name="submit" alt="Make a donation - it's fast, free and secure!" style="padding: 0 15px;" />

</form>

<p>Failing that, you may send me an email asking for my posting address, if you want to contribute in a non-monetary fashion.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
