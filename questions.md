<p><font size="2"><strong>Can I use Color Cop for business, commercial, 
school, or government use? Or is it only free for &quot;personal&quot; use?<br>
</strong>Yes, you may use it for business, commercial, school, and 
government use -- the Color Cop application is free for all of these 
purposes (and also for personal use). You may install it on as 
many systems as you&#39;d like, although we do request and appreciate a
donation to support our ongoing development costs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>I run a website where I mirror lots of 
freeware programs; may I also mirror Color Cop?<br></strong>Yes, so long 
as you do not charge for access to your website, you may absolutely do 
this. Redistribution of Color Cop is permitted so long as it is 
free-of-charge.

<p><font size="2"><strong>May I include Color Cop on a cover CD/DVD that 
is included in the magazine I&#39;m publishing?<br></strong>Yes, in general, 
you may do this so long as you are not charging extra due to the 
inclusion of Color Cop.</font></p>
